## 💻Project

I finished another project!!<br> 
It was a lot of fun to make this watch and also annoying, but in the end it's worth it. Completing another project is a huge satisfaction that gives, because you always leave with more knowledge, I learned more about CSS and JS, practice makes perfect so we have to persist. anyway, I focused more on the design of the clock because I want to improve myself in CSS in the designs.
